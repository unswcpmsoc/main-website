Competitive programming and mathematics are niche fields that require problem-solving skills, logical thinking, and a solid foundation in mathematical concepts. Whether you are a beginner or youâ€™re cracked af, continuous training and improvement are key to excelling in these fields. In this blog, we will explore effective strategies and techniques to train and improve your competitive programming and mathematics skills.

**Understanding the fundamentals:**

To be successful in competitive programming and mathematics, it is important to have a solid foundation in the fundamental concepts. Begin by mastering basic data structures (such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees) and algorithms (such as sort, binary search, and graphs). For mathematics, focus on core topics such as number theory, combinatorics, probability, and algebra. Understanding these concepts will provide a solid framework for advanced problem-solving and can even help with solving some types of programming questions.Â 

**Practice, Practice, Practice:**

Consistent practice is the key to improving your skills. Solving a wide variety of problems regularly will help enhance your problem-solving abilities. Practice coding questions are available on various websites like [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) for more interview-type questions and [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) for more competition-type questions. Explore problem archives from previous contests to practice solving problems with varying degrees of difficulty. For maths, the discrete maths (Math 1081) tutorial questions are a good starting point to develop the thinking skills needed to solve harder questions. In addition, [Putnam and Beyond](http://www.cms.zju.edu.cn/UploadFiles/AttachFiles/201082333637670.pdf) will provide you with more advanced concepts, theories, and questions. Challenge yourself by solving problems beyond your comfort zone to broaden your problem-solving horizons.Â 

**Analyze and Learn from Solutions:**

Solution analysis is one of the best ways to improve at competitive programming and mathematics. Reading over different approaches and solutions in online forums, to studying other participantsâ€™ solutions and ideas will help expose you to different problem-solving techniques, algorithms, and optimizations. This will also help you gain insights into the time and space complexity of solutions to improve the efficiency of your own code.

**Join communities and societies (shameless plug ðŸ™‚)**:

You can join programming and mathematics communities, such as our UNSW Competitive Programming and Mathematics Society, to engage in discussions, ask questions, and collaborate with fellow students. You can also participate in study groups, join our workshops or just hang out in our discord to exchange ideas and learn from each other's experiences.

**Engage in Competitions and Contests:**

Participating in programming contests is an excellent way to put your skills to the test and gain valuable experience. Competitions like the [International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC)](https://icpc.global/) and our [ANZAC comps](https://sppcontests.org/anzac-contests/) offer a platform to compete against other programmers, whilst other competitions like the [Simon Marais Mathematics Competition (SMMC)](https://www.simonmarais.org) offer a platform for mathematics contests. Challenge yourself to solve problems within strict time constraints and familiarize yourself with contest environments. The pressure of contests helps train resilience and adaptability, crucial traits for success.

To conclude, becoming a proficient competitive programmer and mathematician requires dedication, continuous learning, and persistent practice. By focusing on fundamental concepts, practising regularly, analysing solutions, collaborating with others, and engaging in contests, you can sharpen your problem-solving skills and enhance your mathematical prowess. Embrace the challenges, learn from your mistakes, and enjoy the journey of growth and improvement. Remember, success in competitive programming and mathematics is not only about winning but also about the skills and knowledge you acquire along the way.
