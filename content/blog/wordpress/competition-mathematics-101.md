Imagining you are in a Physics Examination and you see the following question on the paper:

<!--more-->

> A bear falls from at rest at 1 metre above the ground. It takes 0.451 seconds to reach the ground. What is the colour of the bear?

How can you solve it? Too hard? Then pretend you are a middle school student in a Geometry class. Your teacher asks you:

> A boy leaves his home. He walks 100 m to the north and turns east to walk another 100 m to find his friends. After arriving, he finds that he forgot the wallet, so he turns south and walks 100 m to go home. Where does he live on the Earth?

A significant part of Competition Mathematics is like this. The first impression is mainly brutally weird “brain teasers”. The “teaser” is more to tease you about not acknowledging the existence of Competition Mathematics. Yes! The competition clique mocks you! You need to understand a few rules before starting to appreciate them. It will be reassuring in the end.

Unlike brain teasers, problems in Competition Mathematics yet have context. Just like you are sitting a regular exam. Recall the last question in the Geometry class. Drawing the figure often helps a lot. You will get a triangle with three right angles after constructing the diagram. What on earth can you get two parallel edges in a triangle? What have you missed? Your teacher probably draws triangles on a whiteboard to teach you triangles. What is the difference between the Earth and a whiteboard? Yes! The globe is round, while a whiteboard is flat. If you have paid 100% attention to your Geometry class, you may recall phases like “plane geometry” and “Euclidean”, etc. They mean that you always assume the problem appears on a flat surface (See note #1). The Earth effectively breaks this assumption. Let’s take out an orange and find where you can draw a triangle with intersecting north-pointing and south-pointing lines. The answer is at the pole because the longitude lines (the line containing all points with the same longitude) only meet at the north and south poles. Specifically, the boy lives at the south pole (probably a researcher) as he goes to the North at the beginning.

Calling Competition Mathematics “brain teasers” is just an overstatement. You will get used to the style when you do enough practice. Most likely, you only see itchy questions at the edge of the understood “syllabus” with many logical twists in competitions. So what is the “syllabus”? CPMSoc provides another [article](https://www.unswcpmsoc.com/cm101/) covering this. But in short, it is mostly something up to level 2 UNSW pure mathematics courses. For example, all high-school stuff, single and multi-variable Calculus, Analysis, Algebra, Linear Algebra, Statistics, Complex Analysis, Combinatorics, Discrete Mathematics, Number Theory, etc. Don’t be discouraged if you have not taken enough courses to cover all. Trust me, even if you know all of them, you may still be shocked in a competition, like looking at the “brain teasers” above. Familiarity with the competition style is crucial.

Why should you consider Competition Mathematics? Who doesn’t enjoy teasing others? Furthermore, the mathematical (logical) thinking you acquired along the journey of Competition Mathematics is an underlooked tool for any job employing quantitative methods.

Practice more is the first step of doing Competition Mathematics. If you still do not know the answer to the question at the beginning, you can consider the following facts:

*   Hints 1:
    *   s = ½ gt2 where s is the “falling distance” in meters, t is the time in seconds, and g is the gravity acceleration in ms–2.
        
    *   Answer:  
        
        Put t = 0.451 and s = 1, we have g = 9.83279.
        
*   Hints 2:
    *   Go to the Wikipedia page of [“Gravity of Earth”](https://web.archive.org/web/20230128014348/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_of_Earth) and see the sentence with the footnote/references 5.
        
    *   Answer:  
        
        The only place with such gravity acceleration is the Arctic Ocean! So the bear is a polar bear!
        

Competition Mathematics is a great way to make yourself more flexible in abstract thinking. If you are interested, please join activities organised by CPMSoc. More information on [https://www.unswcpmsoc.com/](https://www.unswcpmsoc.com/cm101/). 

Note:

*   (#1) For simplicity, you can think of 2-dimensional surfaces only, i.e. flat plane (floor, blackboards and your desks, etc.). But this academic jargon includes “flat” 3-dimensional space too. It roughly assembles the “flatness” in General Relativity.
