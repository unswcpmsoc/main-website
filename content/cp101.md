# Introduction to Competitive Programming

## What is Competitive Programming?

Competitive Programming (CP, also known as Programming Challenges or Informatics) is a mind sport.
Essentially we want to solve computational problems as quickly and accurately as possible using algorithms and data structures.

## Why get involved?

### Improves problem-solving ability

Programming problems are often designed to seem daunting at first, but being able to adapt to competitive environments where there is time pressure improves our ability to think and explore ideas efficiently and effectively. If you keep at it, you will develop the ability to analyse problems quickly and effectively, and recognise the different approaches to solving them.

### Builds implementation skills and understanding of algorithms (which helps with university courses and job interviews!)

The more we practice these kinds of problems, the better our understanding of these algorithms will be.
By doing CP as a hobby, university programming problems will become very approachable. Also, technical interviews for major companies often incorporate some algorithms, techniques and data structures from more standard competitive programming problems. Some common examples are BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's, DP, BSTs, prefix sums, stacks and queues.

Also, you will naturally become better and faster at programming in general by solving problems. You will deepen your understanding of your language, and of what code is capable of.

### Social and networking opportunities

The competitive programming community brings together like-minded people who are all passionate about problem solving and programming. CPMSoc hopes to provide such a community with its regular workshops and social opportunities. Also, by participating in team contests, you will make and develop friendships.
 
By competing in competitions at any level, you will have chances to meet talented programmers out there and build your community along the way. Note that big companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon are in favour of hiring top performers at the competitions they host!

## Competitions

At the heart of competitive programming, of course, are contests. The general idea of a contest is to provide accurate and fast solutions to a number of problems in a set amount of time. 

The most notable university competition is the [International Collegiate Programming Contest](https://icpc.global/) (ICPC). The contests are five hours long with roughly 12 problems, and you compete in teams of three. Generally there are three stages, the Divisionals, Regionals, and World Finals. Divisionals usually occurs around September/October. CPMSoc will let you know when registration is open!

Other competitions include [Google Kick Start](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/kickstart), which is aimed at teaching people who are newer to competitive programming, [Google Code Jam](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam), and [Facebook Hacker Cup](https://www.facebook.com/codingcompetitions/hacker-cup).

There are also many online platforms that have competitions, such as [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) and [Atcoder](https://atcoder.jp/).

Beginners would likely find Codeforces Educational Rounds and Atcoder Beginner Contests to be the most useful, as they have editorials (explanations of solutions) readily available as well as occurring relatively frequently.

## Getting started

### Pick your programming language

One of the prerequisites for CP is knowing how to write and run code. If you are just starting out or even completely new, that's okay â€“ many problems are accessible with only a very basic understanding of programming, and you can learn as you go.

The ICPC-accepted languages are C++, Python and Java. As a beginner, you may want to continue using whatever language you are most familiar with, as long as whatever platform you want to use supports it. However, as you start looking to more advanced problems, there are some differences between languages that you should be aware of.

While Python is easy to write code in, it is much slower than C++ and Java. Between C++ and Java, they each have some features that the other doesn't, but for the vast majority of problems either is fine. If you can only learn one we would recommend C++ as it is the more common language for competitive programming, however each has its pros and cons.

You can also try other languages like Kotlin, Rust or Go to get a taste of how they vary. Even [Gennady Korotkevich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gennady_Korotkevich), arguably the greatest competitive programmer, used to compete using Pascal.

### Training and contests

The best way to get started is to start solving some problems. There are many free online training judges and contests available. The ones we recommend for beginners are Codeforces and Atcoder.

Codeforces has ratings for their problems, and you can search problems by rating at the [Problemset](https://codeforces.com/problemset). For beginners we recommend starting at 800 rating, and slowly moving up if things seem too easy. You can also search problems by specific tags if you want to practice a technique or algorithm. Additionally, at the bottom right of most, if not all, problems there will be a "Tutorial" button, which brings you to a page with an editorial and solution (usually in C++) for the problem.

Atcoder has ratings for individual contests. We recommend looking at past [Atcoder Beginner Contests](https://atcoder.jp/contests/archive?ratedType=1&category=0&keyword=) (ABCs). The problems are usually in order of difficulty so you can try the first couple of problems first, and eventually move on to later ones when you are ready. Like Codeforces, editorials are also available.

Both Codeforces and Atcoder have "Virtual Participation", which lets you attempt past contests under timed conditions, so you can practice performing under time pressure, and see how you would have placed if you competed live.

Codeforces also hosts many past ICPC rounds from different regions, you can search them under the Gym tab, [like so](https://codeforces.com/gyms?filterContestType=Official+ACM-ICPC+Contest&filterContestFormat=ICPC&order=ID_DESC). Be warned though that these should be attempted in teams of three, and can be very difficult.

After a contest, you can and should try to _upsolve_ problems. Upsolving is when you solve a problem after the contest ends. If you only do problems during the contest and forget about the ones you didn't solve, it will be very difficult to improve as you aren't learning anything from the contests.

### Learning algorithms and techniques

As you encounter more difficult problems, building a solid theoretical foundation and intuition for CP in various areas is crucial. Many problems or their solutions will involve specific theory or algorithms, such as data structures, graph theory, mathematics, string processing and computational geometry. Also, many solutions make use of common general approaches, such as greedy algorithms, brute force, dynamic programming and divide and conquer.

By solving more problems, you will develop the ability to quickly and instinctively determine which of these might be useful for a new problem. Fortunately, there is a huge range of online resources to help you learn these concepts.

For beginners, we recommend following a book or course.

For books we recommend [Guide to Competitive Programming](https://www.amazon.com/Guide-Competitive-Programming-Algorithms-Undergraduate/dp/3319725467) or [Competitive Programming 4](https://cpbook.net/). If you do not wish to buy a book, both these books have older versions made available for free by the authors, [Competitive Programmer's Handbook](https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf "https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf") and [Competitive Programming 2](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~stevenha/myteaching/competitive_programming/cp2.pdf) respectively. Both books are good introduction to the vast majority of algorithms and techniques used in competitive programming, but Guide to Competitive Programming / Competitive Programmer's Handbook is easier to follow for beginners, while Competitive Programming 2/4 is much more comprehensive, in terms of providing code, listing problems solvable with each technique so readers can practice, as well as the topics covered. There is also a [code repository](https://github.com/stevenhalim/cpbook-code) available.

The other way to get started is following a course online. A relatively new resource is the [USACO Guide](https://usaco.guide/). An advantage of this is there are external links to other relevant resources, and a lot of code can be provided as there is no space limitation. Additionally, it is roughly structured by difficulty with example problems and solutions with explanations, and will help you get started very quickly. A disadvantage is that since it relies heavily on external sources and community contributions, it is not as consistent in terms of style of writing.

Once you have a good understanding of the most common algorithms and techniques, you will mostly find more advanced techniques through blogs or individual sites. [CP Algorithms](https://cp-algorithms.com/) has an extensive range of explanations and implementations of algorithms and techniques of varying difficulty.

## Further recommended books and resources
[Awesome Competitive Programming list by Inishan](https://github.com/lnishan/awesome-competitive-programming) is a large list of resources with rough explanation of what each item is. This includes books, courses, practice sites and sample code for algorithms.

We recommend taking COMP4128 when you are able to, as it will help you learn more advanced applications of even "simpler" algorithms.

CPMSoc also runs workshops that will help improve your problem solving ability.
