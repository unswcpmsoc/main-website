# Introduction to Competitive Programming

## What is Competitive Programming?

Competitive Programming (CP, also known as Programming Challenges or Informatics) is a mind sport.
Essentially we want to solve computational problems as quickly and accurately as possible using algorithms and data structures.

## Why get involved?

### Improves problem-solving ability

Programming problems are often designed to seem daunting at first. But fighting and overcoming this initial feeling is actually healthy for us. The process of inventing a solution to a hard problem is satisfying and rewarding.

Further, being able to adapt to competitive environments where there is time pressure improves our ability to think and explore ideas efficiently and effectively. If you keep at it, you will develop the ability to analyse problems quickly and effectively, and recognise the different approaches to solving them.

Competitive programming allows you to experience the joy of problem solving and that feeling when you smash it out of the park!

### Builds implementation skills and understanding of algorithms (which helps with university courses and job interviews!)

Often, well-known algorithms and data structures are used solve a problem. Problems rarely require you to just implement a standard algorithm – more often than not there will be some observations that need to be made, allowing us to apply algorithms in new ways.

The more we practice these kinds of problems, the better our understanding of these algorithms will be.
By doing CP as a hobby, university programming problems will become very approachable. Also, technical interviews for major companies often incorporate some algorithms, techniques and data structures from more standard competitive programming problems. Some common examples are BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's, DP, BSTs, prefix sums, stacks and queues.

Also, you will naturally become better and faster at programming in general by solving problems. Although the code you write during contests or practice isn't judged on being clean or clear, you will deepen your understanding of your language, and of what code is capable of.

### Social and networking opportunities

The competitive programming community brings together like-minded people who are all passionate about problem solving and programming. CPMSoc hopes to provide such a community with its regular workshops and social opportunities. Also, by participating in team contests, you will make and develop friendships.
 
By competing in competitions at any level, you will have chances to meet talented programmers out there and build your community along the way. Note that big companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon are in favour of hiring top performers at the competitions they host!

## Competitions

At the heart of competitive programming, of course, are contests. These contests will make you become used to what techniques can be applied, what tricks are available, what data structures to pick, and what's necessary to do during the timeframe of solving a problem.

These are some of the most notable programming competitions:

### International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC)

[ICPC](https://icpc.global/) is the largest competition at the university undergraduate level. You compete in teams of three, and the contests are five hours long with around ten problems.

There are generally three stages of ICPC in the region UNSW competes in: Divisionals, Regionals and World Finals. Your team must qualify in the Regionals to advance to the World Finals.

As a side note, UNSW finished sixth in the 2018 ICPC World Finals, which is the South Pacific region's greatest accomplishment of all time.

> "Our region won it in 1990 and 1992 but neither Russian nor Chinese universities were competing back then thus it wasn't as much of a "worldwide" competition as it is now. In addition, the level of difficulty is incomparable."

### ANZAC Rounds

[ANZAC Rounds](https://www.facebook.com/groups/SPPContest/) are regularly held in our region, to allow competitors to regularly practice in ICPC style contests.

### Google's Coding Competitions
[Kick Start](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/kickstart) is a contest with multiple rounds. You can compete in as many or as few as you want! It's mainly aimed at people who are newer to competitive programming.

[Code Jam](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam), on the other hand, is overall more challenging and harder than Kick Start. There are multiple rounds, which are all online except for the final round:

- Qualification Round (open to all). As of 2021, you are allowed to discuss problems during this round – CPMSoc runs discussion sessions for it)
- Round 1 (everyone who got a certain number of points in the qualification round). There are three opportunities – 1A, 1B and 1C – to qualify for Round 2.
- Round 2 (top 4500: top 1500 in each of 1A, 1B and 1C).
- Round 3 (top 1000). Anyone who gets here gets a T-shirt!
- The final round (top 25).

### Other contests

[Facebook Hacker Cup](https://www.facebook.com/codingcompetitions/hacker-cup) is quite well known and has a similar structure to Google Code Jam.

There are also regular online contests on various sites, and you can use [this site](https://clist.by/) to remind you of upcoming contests. We also have notifications in our Discord server. Notable contest sites include [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/), [Atcoder](atcoder.jp), USACO, Luogu, Topcoder, Hackerrank, Codechef and Leetcode.

 Some notes about certain contests:
- [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/): The easiest problems are rated at 800. Within 1 month, if you aren't struggling, you should be able to try problems rated at 1200. Pro tip: you can review other people’s submissions and learn their solutions. Also, don’t mind that leaderboard. Rating is just a number.
- [Atcoder](https://atcoder.jp/) Solve ABCs and use [this](https://kenkoooo.com/atcoder#/table/) to track your progress. [Here](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/66909) is a strategy on how to boost your rating with Atcoder.
- HackerRank and Leetcode are good for interview practice and learning a programming language. However, problems are generally less sophisticated.

## Getting started

### Pick your programming language

One of the prerequisites for CP is knowing how to write and run code. If you are just starting out or even completely new, that's okay – many problems are accessible with only a very basic understanding of programming, and you can learn as you go.

The ICPC-accepted languages are C++, Python and Java. As a beginner, you may want to continue using whatever language you are most familiar with, as long as whatever platform you want to use supports it. However, as you start looking to more advanced problems, there are some differences between languages that you should be aware of.

Python is often known as a beginner-friendly language that is easy and fast to program in. This is generally true but a Python program often runs many times slower than an equivalent one in C++ or Java. For some problems, this is not an issue, but there will be times where it may be incredibly difficult or even impossible to solve a problem in Python because of a problem's time limit.

Now, between Java and C++, C++ is the more common language, especially at UNSW. COMP4128 Programming Challenges is taught with C++. C++ has a vast standard library of useful data structures and algorithms. However, there are some areas that Java beats it in. Java has big integers, regular expressions and geometry libraries, which are useful in a small number of problems.

Many competitors at UNSW use Python for simpler problems or problems involving strings or big integers (which are more manageable in Python), and switch to C++ for more complicated problems where time may be an issue, or the C++ library would be helpful. If you can only learn one language, we recommend C++, but each has situations where it shines.

You can also try other languages like Kotlin, Rust or Go to get a taste of how they vary. Even [Gennady Korotkevich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gennady_Korotkevich), arguably the greatest competitive programmer, used to compete using Pascal.

### Training and contests

The best way to get started is to start solving some problems. There are many free online training judges and contests available. The following are great for beginners, but more are listed at the end of this page.

- [CS Academy](https://csacademy.com/contest/archive/tasks/), [Sphere Online Judge (https://www.spoj.com/) and [CSES Problem Set Website](https://cses.fi/problemset/list/) are tried and tested classics, and have many problems for beginners.
- The easier public AIO problems on [ORAC2](https://orac2.info/) usually do not require hard (if any) techniques, rather they mainly intend to test ad hoc problem solving ability. 

Contests are fun and should motivate you to keep learning. It may seem scary to "compete", but really it is just about learning and having fun, so it is never too early to start trying contests.

The most popular platforms actively try to include beginners. For example, [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) educational rounds, or division 3 and 4 rounds are tailored to beginners. [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp/) also has beginner contests. Google's [Kick Start](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/kickstart) rounds also have some interesting problems. These all have editorials (high-level explanations of solutions) available after the contest, which you can look at if you are stuck – but only if you have thought about the problem for a while and are really stuck!

After a contest, you can and should try to _upsolve_ problems. Upsolving is when you solve a problem after the contest ends. If you only do problems during the contest and forget about the ones you didn't solve, it will be very difficult to improve as you aren't learning anything from the contests.

Contest technique, the art of maximising your score in a contest, has many aspects to it, many of which you will develop naturally by competing. In a future CPMSoc blog post we may discuss some important tips, though.

### Learning algorithms and techniques

As you encounter more difficult problems, building a solid theoretical foundation and intuition for CP in various areas is crucial. Many problems or their solutions will involve specific theory or algorithms, such as data structures, graph theory, mathematics, string processing and computational geometry. Also, many solutions make use of common general approaches, such as greedy algorithms, brute force, dynamic programming and divide and conquer.

By solving more problems, you will develop the ability to quickly and instinctively determine which of these might be useful for a new problem. Fortunately, there is a huge range of online resources to help you learn these concepts.
- If you'd prefer to follow a book, then the [Competitive Programmer's Handbook](https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf "https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf") is good, as it simultaneously covers techniques and implementation in c++, starting out at an introductory level.
- [CP Algorithms](https://cp-algorithms.com/) has an extensive range of explanations and implementations of algorithms and techniques of varying difficulty.
- Wikipedia, and most sites that commonly show up when you google computer science topics, can be very instructive for specific topics.
